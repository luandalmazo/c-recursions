Hey there!

This is basically a notebook of recursions exercises made with C language

# What is a recursion? ðŸ“š
A recursion is a function that call itself, it can improve the efficiency and decrease the cust of your code!

# Running ðŸ’»
Bellow, i going to explain how can you run this script without any problem, in this case i going to use Linux, but the steps are almost the same in anothers operational systems!

First of all, you need to install the GCC for compiling:

```
sudo apt install gcc 
```
after that, you have to open your terminal (CTRL+ALT+T), find the place that you had done the clone (you can use the command "cd"), and open the paste. Then, just type:

```
gcc -o name name_of_file.c
```
and
```
./name
```

There it is, have fun!
